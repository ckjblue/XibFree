# XibFree - A lightweight, code-only layout engine for iOS/MonoTouch

## Sorry :( This Project is not longer under development or maintenance.  The repo is kept here for posterity only.

XibFree is a simple layout engine for code-only layouts in Xamarin.iOS (aka MonoTouch)

* Code only layouts - no more Xib files.
* Leverages C# language features to define layouts in a concise, flexible and powerful way.
* Supports LinearLayout - the workhorse of automatic layout.
* Supports FrameLayout - for overlaid views.
* Deliberately uses Android terminology and concepts make it instantly familiar for cross-platform developers.
* Extremely light weight, uses UIViews directly without any re-wrapping or property delegation.
* Easily integrated into any existing MonoTouch project - it's not a framework so you can use it as much or as little as you like!

### A Quick Example

The following is a really simple example to show what a typical XibFree layout looks like:

```C#
var layout = new LinearLayout(Orientation.Horizontal)
{
	Padding = new UIEdgeInsets(10, 10, 10, 10),
	LayoutParameters = new LayoutParameters()
	{
		Width = AutoSize.FillParent,
		Height = AutoSize.WrapContent,
	},
	SubViews = new View[]
	{
		new NativeView()
		{
			View = new UILabel()
			{
				Text = "Hello World, from XibFree",
				TextColor = UIColor.White,
				BackgroundColor = UIColor.Clear,
			},
			LayoutParameters = new LayoutParameters()
			{
				Width = AutoSize.FillParent,
				Height = AutoSize.FillParent,
			}
		},
		new NativeView()
		{
			View = new UIImageView()
			{
				Image = UIImage.FromBundle("tts512.png"),
				ContentMode = UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit,
			},
			LayoutParameters = new LayoutParameters()
			{
				Width = 40,
				Height = 40,
			}
		}
	},
};
```

Which results in this:

### Why Code-Only Layout?

 Xamarin's Michael James says it pretty concisely on the [Xamarin iOS Forum](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/1164/ios-layout-in-c#):

> *... code-only layouts have a number of other advantages. To start with, many properties and behaviors of iOS layout are not exposed in Xcodeâ€™s Interface designer. Additionally, keeping layouts in C# also allows for easier management and tracking of UI changes for development teams and makes it easier to merge changes which can be extremely time consuming when developing with xibs.*
